# Resiliency Maps project

   Know your surroundings
   Support your community

Fires. Floods. Earthquakes. Heatwaves. Hurricanes. Landslides.

Resilience has never been more important â€” or more urgent. The ability to adapt,
act and spring back is essential. Knowing your neighborhood before an emergency
hits can help save lives as well as reduce injuries and property damage.
 
## Scope of the project

We aim to establish a virtuous circle. Reacting quickly and calmly is vital. When
official resources may be stretched, resiliency maps enable individuals and
communities to evaluate needs and cooperate quickly.

A Resiliency Map stores information about assets, resources and hazards within a
given geographical area. They can be printed and housed offline -a crucial
advantage when electricity and connectivity may down or disrupted for days.
During the first few hours or days following an event, essential services are likely
to be unavailable and people should expect to act on their own. These maps provide
critical information to people during an emergency response, turning awareness into
action.

Some of the useful features highlighted on a Resiliency Map may include fire
hydrants, cisterns, shelters, construction sites and chemical hazard warnings 
posted outside gas stations, car repair shops and the like. Following an event, 
these maps can also be used to track damage.
